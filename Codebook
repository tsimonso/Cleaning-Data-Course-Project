***  This codebook is written on the assumption that the reader has some familiarity with the original datasets used for this course project.

Variable Descriptions:

Two sets of variables are described below.  The first set [1] of variables indicate a combination of subject and subject activity for which data are collected.  The second set [2] of variables represent the data collected.

[1]

Variables:
“SubjectID” – Identification number for the subject from whom data is collected.  Numerically valued to 
	represent one of 30 subjects.
“SubjectActivity” – Describes what activity the subject performed for data collection.  Character valued
	with six levels (Sitting, Standing, Laying, Walking, Walking Upstairs, and Walking Downstairs).

[2]

Rather than provide an individual description for each variable, the elements of the variables themselves are described to adequately establish the meaning of each variable.

“t” : Domain is time.  No unit of measurement. Data is normalized and bound within [-1,1].
“f” : Domain is frequency. No unit of measurement. Data is normalized and bound within [-1,1].
“Body” : Data measurement is an effect of body movement.
“Gravity” : Data measurement is an effect of gravitational force.
“Acc” : Data is measured from the sensor signal of a accelerometer.
“Gyro” : Data is measured from the sensor signal of a gyroscope.
“Jerk” : Jerk measurement calculated deriving the signals from the accelerometer and the gyroscope.
“Mag” : A magnitude measurement calculated using the Euclidean norm
“X,Y,Z” : Indicate the direction of movement for which the measurement was taken.
“mean() : The measurement is the mean of collected data.
“std()” : The measurement is the standard deviation of collected data.

Additional Information:

The data in the final tidy data set is an average of the data collected for each “SubjectID” and “SubjectActivity” combination.  Example:  If “SubjectID  == 1” and “SubjectActivity == Sitting” had 30 observations in the original data, the final tidy dataset takes the average of all 30 observations to form one observation.

The data measurements for all variables in set [2] are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The variables in set [2] are a subset of the 561 variables included in the original dataset.  Only variables indicating a mean or standard deviation measurement were used, with one exception.  Variables from the original dataset that indicated a mean frequency measurement were excluded from the final tidy dataset.
